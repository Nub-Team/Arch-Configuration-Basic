This is my configuration for DWM, DMENU, DWSTATUS, and ST

INSTALL:
- run "chmod +x install-dependencies.sh"
- then execute with "./install-dependencies.sh"
- move dwm, dmenu, st, dwmstatus, dwm-bar,  and .xinitrc to ~/
- open .xinitrc in an editor and adjust the resolution to your liking at the bottom
- for each folder, go into the directory and type "sudo make clean install"
- reboot
- login
- execute "startx" to run dwm
- open nitrogen, and change your wallpaper
- enjoy
